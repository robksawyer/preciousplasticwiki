PDFEmbed
========

[PDFEmbed](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PDFEmbed) allows Adobe Acrobat PDF files to be embedded into a wiki article using <pdf></pdf> tags. The PDF file extension is automatically added and necessarily default permissions are configured. Future functionality will allow this extension to act as a media handler for PDF files.


Installation

To install this extension, add the following to the end of the LocalSettings.php file:
```php

require("$IP/extensions/PDFEmbed/PDFEmbed.php");
```

Configuration
